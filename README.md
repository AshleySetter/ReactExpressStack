# ReactExpressStack
A minimal example of a server back-end running on express and front-end running on react. This project hard-codes some json data in the express backend and retrieves the data in the react front-end and displays the names in a list.

Created following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0t42xBIYIs).
